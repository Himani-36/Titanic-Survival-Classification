# Titanic-Survival-Classification

Requirements

1) Python , jupyter notebook.
2) Numpy, Pandas, seaborn and sklearn library.

This dataset has passenger information who boarded the Titanic along with other information like survival status, Class, Fare, and other variables. The unfortunate event which was occurred on 15 April 1912, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, aboard 2224 peoples.

This project addresses the following Data Analysis topics:

1) Data Exploration and Preparation

2) Data Representation and Transformation

3) Data Visualization and Presentation

Data Exploration and Preparation Learn about data: Are there missing data? Is it categorical? if not, min , max, avg values? if yes, what are the categories? distribution of variables Duplicate entry


Transformation on dataframe: Droping some of the columns which many not contribute much to our machine learning model such as Name, Ticket, Cabin etc

Data Visualization and Presentation Age distribution per class.
Upper-class passenger median Age - 36 years Middle-class passenger median Age - 29 years Lower- class passenger median Age - 26 years
rest all presentation is on jupyter python file Titanic Data ML.ipynb

The given dataset has entries of 891 peoples.

sklearn is used for the machine learning algorithm(XG Boost) with score around 88.9%
